#  Feeling Wheel for Emotional Health
#  Key to Emotional Health is to identify and acknowledge current state of emotion.
#  and set intentions to reach the opposite side of the wheel if need.
#  This approach is based on the idea that our emotions are not in the logical part of the brain.
#  Often, we don't identify it because we are being emotional!
#  Once we identify our emotion, it becomes a matter of solving y=x+a.
#  x is our current emotion, and y is our goal.  To reach y from x, we just need "a" bit of good old excercise.
